        I am obliged for the opportunity to serve as a President of RC RCCIIT in Rota year 2022-23.
        
        Binding together the knowledge I acquired during my active involvement as Chair of Community Service
        as well as through my serving in designing,it's an asset to pass on the aspects about Rotaract to my
        Smart working juniors as well as batchmates. I aim to rectify the loopholes establish an
        theme to ' Agitate. Aspire. Achieve'
        Following the motto of not hesitating to agitate brains to come up with ideas that contribute effectively
        to every cause that it becomes a part of and try to aspire to achieve all that is needed to be done to fulfil
        desired goals.`,

        My dearest Rotaracters
        
        "You need imagination in order to imagine a future that doesn't exist."
        
        Its my immense pleasure to serve as a Rotaractor for the past few years. I hope my imagination and
        hardwork brought some smiles in others life. Serving as a secretary (admin) for this Rota year 2022-23
        from the Rotaract Club of Rcciit is itself a greatful as well as challenging task for me. I will try to hold the
        responsibilities towards good work and showcasing talents of my fellow members through team work in
        upcoming significant events. Its my request to every member to imagine in order to bring new ideas and
        try to implement them to keep this movement alive. Thank you everyone for being with me. Have a great
        year`

        shaped me into a completely different person. For me, Rotaract has been a place to learn, grow and

        Thank you to all my seniors for giving me this opportunity to serve the club at this level and all my
        colleagues and juniors for their immense support and trust.

        My rotaract journey started from being a general member of Rotaract Club of RCCIIT in 2019 to Chair of finance for RY
        2021-22 & currently being the Treasurer of the club. This year came in with a lot of responsibilities which
        i can only fulfill with sheer hardwork. It's almost 4 years that i have joined RCCIIT. I found a family in
        RCCIIT which always motivates me to be the best version of me.
        
        I had given my best to serve the society with my team. RCCIIT IS NOT A CLUB, It's like FAMILY to me.`
